title: Gatsby Docs Translation Guide
---

Since the [RFC on localization](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/rfcs/pull/42) for Gatsby, there is now an ongoing effort to translate the content on Gatsbyjs.org into multiple languages. For members of the community around the world building Gatsby sites and learning about web development, having docs and learning materials in your own language provides a lot of value. There's also a great opportunity for folks like you to contribute to the translations of the Gatsby docs.

If you're a native speaker of a language other than English and you're interested in helping translate gatsbyjs.org, here is some information for you to know:

## The general process

Each translation has its own repository in the [gatsbyjs](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/) organization on GitHub, with two or three designated codeowners to review and approve changes. This doc will outline how to request a new language repository with its own team, what decisions each team can make, and suggestions for how you can work together.

The Gatsby learning team is in charge of determining priorities for which docs should be translated. Refer to the [i18n page spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u2amGnqFLKxJuL5h9UrDblUueFgg0EBt7xbau4n8iTM/edit) to get the most up-to-date priority list.

> ⚠️ Note: All contributors are expected to follow the [Gatsby Code of Conduct](/contributing/code-of-conduct/) and work professionally with fellow contributors. For issues with conduct, if you are unable to work things out amicably amongst yourselves (perhaps after filing a public issue), you can contact the Gatsby team at [conduct@gatsbyjs.com](mailto:conduct@gatsbyjs.com) with details about the situation.

## Use English as the source

The [gatsbyjs.org](https://gatsbyjs.org) website is written in English and should be considered the source material for all translations (as opposed to translating from another translation). When a repository is created, it will provide the space to copy over prioritized docs and [make pull requests](/contributing/how-to-open-a-pull-request/) against them in the relevant language.

## Process for starting a new translation

The first step for starting a new translation is to check what exists. So far, there are repositories for the following languages:

- [Spanish](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-es)
- [Russian](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-ru)

> Note: Once a new translation repository is created, feel free to add it here in a PR!

### Finding 2-3 codeowners

For a new translation, open an issue with information about your intended language. If you already have co-contributors to act as fellow [code owners](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-code-owners) and provide checks and balances for PR reviews and quality assurance, that would be very helpful! Otherwise, you can check out the [RFC](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/rfcs/pull/42) for interested participants or [get in touch with us](/contributing/how-to-contribute/#not-sure-how-to-start-contributing) at Gatsby for help in building your translation team.

## Contributing to a translation

Once a language repository is created and someone on the Gatsby team has assigned codeowners, contributions can begin. It is up to the discretion of the contributor how exactly they want to work, but it's recommended to limit the scope of PRs to 1-3 docs at a time to aid with code reviewing.

Maintainers of a translation are expected to review translations for quality, friendly and encouraging tone of voice, and technical accuracy. These qualities should be considered in every pull request regardless of who it comes from; contributions should be encouraged from anyone in the community, not just maintainers.

If disputes arise, having a conversation on Discord or over a GitHub issue should be the start. If all attempts have been made and something can not be resolved on your own, you can contact the Gatsby team at [conduct@gatsbyjs.com](mailto:conduct@gatsbyjs.com) with details about the situation.

### Code review process

    - Invite comments for a code review process (Google Translate, etc.)

### Templates for responses on PRs

    - PR templates for responses (e.g. non-meaningful changes, etc.)

## Which decisions are flexible? Which are firm guidelines?

## Language-specific maintainer channels

Each translation group may want to have your own communication channels for maintainers and community members to ask questions and coordinate the project. Discord is the most recommended option but there are alternatives, and maintainers can ultimately choose their own communication channel(s). Here are some recommendations:

- [Discord](https://gatsby.dev/discord)
- Wechat
- Whatsapp
- GitHub groups

To set up a Discord channel or GitHub group, [ping the Gatsbyjs team](/contributing/how-to-contribute/#not-sure-how-to-start-contributing).
